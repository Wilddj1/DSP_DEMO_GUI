# DSP_DEMO_GUI
A gui used to teach basic concepts of DSOP and PCM. This Application was made using the PyQt framework and can be compiled into a portable .exe executable using `pyintsaller` passing the `DSP_SIM.spec` file as an argument.
To run this script you ideally would need a conda env with `pyside6`, `numpy` and `matplotlib` installed.
